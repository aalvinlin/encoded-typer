# encoded-typer

Train your fluency in decoding various types of encodings:
 - ROT 13
 - Number (1-26)
 - Pigpen cipher
 - Braille
 - Semaphore

Specify the length and contents of the ciphertext and begin typing. When you have correctly typed all the characters, your typing speed* in words per minute (WPM) will be displayed at the bottom.

\* This should be an approximation of your decoding speed (assuming that your normal typing speed is faster than your decoding, and that you are typing as quickly as you can decode).
